## Proposal

### Problem Observation

* Choosing the Right Recipe:
  * Skill Level Barrier: Many young individuals face difficulty in selecting recipes that align with their cooking skills, often leading to frustration and disinterest.
  * Time Constraints: With busy schedules, finding recipes that are quick and easy to prepare remains a significant challenge.
  * Dietary Balance: People aiming for a balanced diet often struggle to find varied recipes that utilize the same set of ingredients, hindering their ability to maintain a consistent, healthy diet.
* Food Waste: Inexperienced cooks frequently encounter the issue of food waste, primarily due to a lack of knowledge in effectively pairing and utilizing various ingredients.
* Accessibility of Online Resources:
  * Dietary and Cuisine Limitations: Online recipe resources often fall short in catering to specific dietary needs (like vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free options) and diverse cuisine preferences. This limitation becomes particularly evident during home-hosted dinner parties.
* Grocery Shopping Challenges:
  * Purchasing Decisions: Novice cooks can find grocery shopping daunting, especially when it comes to selecting the right ingredients in appropriate quantities for their cooking endeavors.
